### Project Synopsis

This project allowed me to start learning the syntax and structure of a react application, which I thoroughly enjoyed learning. React is a powerful tool, and I am looking forward to working with it more. Since the most assets were already provided to me, the project was straightforward and easy to tackle. I chose to format the mobile display first, hiding the "Write a story" and "Sign In/Sign Up" in a menu button, and then formatting the content of the website in a column. As the screen expands, both the banner and articles change their display to be a row. Pictures are provided below.
